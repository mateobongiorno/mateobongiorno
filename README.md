Hi, Iâ€™m @mateobongiorno.

I have two years of experience as a Python developer, working with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, etc. Four years of experience in web development working with languages such as HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP.

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer and I am working on several projects using ML algorithms and applying data science technics. And using technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Flask, Git, Docker, etc.

I am passionate about science, programming, and data. I strengthen my knowledge daily and dream of acquiring new ideas to be able to integrate them into my projects.

I believe in a better world for everyone and this will be possible thanks to artificial intelligence!
